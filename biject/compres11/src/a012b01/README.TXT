 This is a bijective file to "1" "0" string converter.
To and from a file of bytes.


1000 ... being used. Here is the first few mappings
The file fintiely odd there is alsways a 100.. in the
infinite expansion the only infinite strings note used
are those that don't have a last "1" a finite distance
in the infinite expansion.


100... 1
010... 0
110... 11
001... 00
101... 10
011,,, 01  ans etc,


and so use as
a012b10.exe filein fileout
the ones with the g added to are minggw executables
the ones that don't end in g are the djgpp executables
use at your own risk
