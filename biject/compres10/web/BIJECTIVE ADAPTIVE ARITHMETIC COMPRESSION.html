 This is a prodcedure to change a simple arithmetic
compressor and change it to a 
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210512085751/http://bijective.dogma.net/arib.zip">bijective adaptive arithmetic compressor</a> so
that any 8-bit binary file can be thought of as
either a compressed file or as a uncompressed file.<p>
 The disadvantages of a standard arithmetic compressor
are two fold. One you carry a wasted table entry for
the EOF symbol which forces other entries to have a
slightly longer encoding. Two you have to write an
EOF symbol to the compressed file every time you
terminate the compressing so many times you add
this last character even when its not needed.</p><p>
  There are many ways to make an arithmetic compressor
bijective. They just don't seem to be in the open
literature. I feel that the reason for this is that
compression that is not bijective can greatly weaken
encryption.</p><p>
  One clever way to do a bijective arithmetic compressor
is to do it the way Matt Timmermans did it with his 
method of multiple free ends. I am going to do it an
alternate way that I hope is easy to follow.</p><p>
  Fist look at a huffman tabel where symbols are
arranged in order from least likely to most likely
</p></h3>
<pre>A 1111
B 1110
C 110
D 101
E 100
F 011
G 010
H 00
</pre>
<h3>

 When writting a bijective huffman compressor I normally compress
to the infinite finitely odd file. This file has a one a finite
distance into the string that is the last one in the string.
Later I map from this string to a 8-bit field file. I cover
this transform in other places at my website.<p>
  Since to end one really wants to make sure the last symbol
has a one bit in it. Notice the H symbol does not. So any time
a file ends with H or H followed by E's I could add one more
E and then I have a unique representation in infinite bit stream
I am compressing to.  </p><p>
  First thing to note is that I really didn't have to use
the E symbol any symbol other than H could have been used.
For my simple adaptive aritmetic bijective compressor I
choose to use G the next most frequently used symbol.
This is great for Huffman where every symbol used has at least
one bit and G from table above will always have at least one
one bit set. What about in arithmetic?</p><p>
  Well H in arithmetic since its the most common symbol could
have less then "one bit". What is lower limit on G ( the next
most probable symbol ) That limit is "one bit" and that occurs
when H occurs 50% of the time and G occurs the other 50% of the
time with rest of symbol occuring 0% of time. Also note
any time G is longer than One bit H is as long or longer than
G in terms of number of bits. Also notice any time H less then
one bit since it makes up more than 50% likely hood and G has to
be less than 50% so that its going to be more than one bit in
length.</p><p>
   Next now that will know G is at least one bit. How can we
be sure that it will contian a one bit.</p><p>
Look at Top_values its all ones. notice that when you stop
playing at the end of encoding each symbol. There is a "High"
and a "Low" value state that is carried into start of encoding
each symbol. Notice also the low at carryover always starts
with a "zero" ( most significant bit) and the high always
starst with a "one". What a person is doing is allowing
only the next bits to come from that range. Since the second
most common symbol is after the first it and it smallest
length is 1 it has to have a one.</p><p>
   Here is a good point for you to test my code. It will always
be as small or smaller than the old way.
it incudes examples you can get it <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210512085751/http://bijective.dogma.net/arib.zip">here</a>
</p><p>
   The next question is even though its bijective could one
save more space than my simple example. Yes one way is by
choosing a different arangement of where in the table you
place the segments. For example I only write out extra end
symbol when the last symbol was all zeroes. It makes
sense to make the least occuring symbol to use the all
zero segment. But one has to be carful since if you do this
you have to assure your self that the most common symbol
has partial bit stream that will force a one or you have to
make code complicated. One could use different arrangements
of segments depending on how many bits have to be written
if the next symbol is last symbol. This I think could become
quite complicated and one can even consider the final length
when its coverted to a file in ones planning of how to
arrange the segments for minium length. There might be a
payoff in encryption or when one is forced to squeeze last
drop out. Such as trying to compress to a small fixed space.</p><p>
 I feel this also leads to a better huffman set for the table
than model I used above.</p><p>
The normal conical model is.
</p></h3>
<pre>A 0000
B 0001
C 001
D 010
E 011
F 100
G 101
H 11

But one can see this not optimal. Better would be
A = 0000
B = 0001
C = 001
D = 011
E = 111
F = 010
G = 110   
H = 10
</pre>
<h3>
Since more files end in H it should be shortest . By
shortest when last symbol you only count distance to last one bit.
Since A is all zeroes it can't be last byte. You need to
pick repeat symbol. You could use any of them as the repeat.
You could even see what the final output file would look like
and choose B or C or F or H to position the last "one" when
if occurs so that the conversion you select to make the fintely
odd file a BYTE file that the one is chopped off. Like wise
if the current ending would result in a 001 from the C character
being such that the 1 bit is cut off. You give G that string
and slide rest up to C so that your more apt to save a byte.<p>
 One last comment if you know the last symbol of a file is
always "X" then you always drop the last symbol of the file
and compress normally and on decompression you add it in.
